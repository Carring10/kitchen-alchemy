    "description": "This butternut squash soup offers a delightful blend of sweet and savory flavors. The natural sweetness of the roasted butternut squash and caramelized yellow onion pairs beautifully with the earthy warmth of garlic. A hint of nutmeg adds a subtle spice that enhances the soup's richness, while a dash of black pepper balances the sweetness with a gentle kick. Perfect for cozy days, this soup delivers a velvety texture and layers of wholesome taste.",

      "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the butternut squash on the pan and drizzle each half with just enough olive oil to lightly coat the squash on the inside (about ½ teaspoon each). Rub the oil over the inside of the squash and sprinkle it with salt and pepper.",
      "Turn the squash face down and roast until it is tender and completely cooked through, about 40 to 50 minutes (don’t worry if the skin or flesh browns—that’s good for flavor). Set the squash aside until it’s cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, in a large soup pot, warm 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat until shimmering, Add the chopped onion and 1 teaspoon salt. Stirring often until the onion has sofened and is golden on the edges. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute, stirring frequently",
      "Use a spoon to scoop the butternut squash flesh into the soup pot. Discard the skin. Add the nutmeg and black pepper. Pour in 3 cups vegetable broth.",
      "Take an emulsion blender (or pour the mixture into a stand blender) and blend until smooth.",
